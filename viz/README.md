d3.js Calendar View Heatmap
===========

*d3.js* visualization of a calendar heatmap.

[Demo can be viewed here](http://kathyz.github.io/d3-calendar/)

A new layout compared with [the original d3.js calendar](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318).
The visualization in this repository is better suited for data that span over a couple years, as opposed to decades.

Features:

* tooltip hover
* month and year labels



## Running the visualization

Simply `cd` into the directory and run a localhost from there.

I recommend using this command:
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
